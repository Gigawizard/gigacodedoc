# Git Workflow

In your work directory, create a file to work on (ex: eggparser.js, README.md, git_commands.md, etc.)

Once you are done working on your file and you have saved it, add it to your remote repository with the following command:

`git add [filename]`

To commit this file and explain with a brief message what you have modified, use the following command:

`git commit -m "Brief description of file changes"`

Once you have explained your changes to your file and are ready to upload to the remote repository on Github, use the following command:

`git push`

Use this workflow as you make changes to your project.
